# Sorting Visualizer

### Description
The program allows you to choose from a series of sorting algorithms such as:

    - [ ] Insertion sort
    - [ ] Selection sort
    - [ ] Odd even sort
    - [X] Gnome sort
    - [ ] Cocktail shaker sort

    - [ ] Merge sort

After choosing a sorting algorithm the program will shuffle the values using the
Fisher-Yates algorithm.

You can press "Space" to start the sorting.
You can control the sorting speed with the arrow keys. Left arrow key decreases
the speed and the right arrow key increases the speed.

Prerequisites:
