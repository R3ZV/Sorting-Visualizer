After choosing a sorting algorithm the program will shuffle the values using the
Fisher-Yates algorithm.

### Controls
You can press "Space" to start the sorting.
You can control the sorting speed with the arrow keys. Left arrow key decreases
the speed and the right arrow key increases the speed.

Prerequisites:
